A logo spread awareness of the infamous CBOMB issue

## Background

The CBOMB is a flaw that is *purposefully* integrated into the Sony PlayStation 3, 4 and 5 (I also speculate the PlayStation 6 would also be affected) that will affect each console's value and utility for retrogaming in the future.

Much like a desktop or laptop computer, each PlayStation from the original to the current PlayStation 5 contains a CMOS battery. The battery powers a small chip that stores the current date and time. When the battery expires the console can't remember the date and time meaning it must be re-entered by the user each time the console is powered on.

As a means of protecting trophy (PlayStation's achievement system) integrity the console will lock the user out of games if the CMOS battery expires and it cannot reach the PlayStation Network. Sony announced and then backpedalled removing the PlayStation Store from the PlayStation 3 revealling their intentions to sunset the console. A safe assumption would be the eventual disconnection of the PlayStation Network as well at some point in the future.

## How does this affect my PlayStation?

This issue affects the PlayStation 3 differently as it will still launch and allow gameplay of physical disks. However, for the PlayStation 4 and 5 **all** games tested would not work regardless of being a physical disk or digital download.

The PlayStation Vita being a handheld does not have a CMOS battery and is therefore not vulnerable to CBOMB.

## The logo

I have designed a quick logo in Affinity Designer to help raise awareness of CBOMB and keep the issue in the public concious. It's not great and I welcome contributions and outright redesigns.

## Licencing

The logo is CC0. The goal of this project is a good logo people want to share to raise awareness of CBOMB. I really don't want to regret not being able to play PlayStation exclusives on the consoles I own because this got in the way.
